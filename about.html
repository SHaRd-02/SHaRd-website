      Hello, World! <br />
      I'm =SHard, welcome to my website. This is my first project as "web
      developer", because I'm not really studying that lol. <br />
      This website is just for me to learn how to code in JavaScript and how to
      use HTML and CSS. I'm studying a Mechatronics <br />
      Engineering degree, which is not that related to web development to be
      honest, but idk maybe some day I'll need this skill <br />
      It's also something fun that I wanted to learn.
